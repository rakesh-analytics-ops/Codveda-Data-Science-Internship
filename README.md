## Overview
This repository contains my completed tasks for the Codveda Technology Data Science Internship. The projects demonstrate my ability to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing using Python.

## Level 1 – Basic
### Customer Churn Analysis (EDA & Preprocessing)
- Cleaned and validated telecom customer data
- Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding
- Visualized churn patterns and feature correlations
- Extracted business insights for customer retention strategies

## Level 2 – Intermediate
### House Price Prediction (Regression)
- Built a linear regression model
- Evaluated performance using MSE and R² score

### Customer Churn Classification
- Trained a logistic regression model
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Tested model on unseen data for real-world performance

## Level 3 – Advanced
### Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
- Preprocessed text data
- Applied TF-IDF feature extraction
- Trained Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NLP (TF-IDF, Naive Bayes)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Acknowledgment
I thank Codveda Technology for providing this internship opportunity and hands-on experience in applied data science.
